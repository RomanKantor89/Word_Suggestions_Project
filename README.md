# Word_Suggestions_Project
C++ Project that uses a Tree structure and recursive methods that checks spelling and generates word suggestions based on a part string.   
This program can not be tested because the main cannot be included in the public repository. However, the methods are well documented and the goal of the Tree is clear. The tree is working based on the number of ABC letters which is 26, this way if there is another subtree in a specific index we know that that letter exists and so on. View the code to see comments and understand what each method does.
